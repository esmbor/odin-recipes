    <ul>
        <li>Boneless Chicken</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Asparagus</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Place one chicken breast on a cutting board.<br>
            Cover chicken breast with plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until 3/4-inch thick.<br>
            Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>    
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a very-large skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
            Add chicken and cook until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway.<br>
            Remove chicken from the skillet; set aside. </li>   
        <li>Add asparagus to the skillet. Cook over medium-high, until bright green and crisp tender, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
            Remove asparagus from the skillet; set aside. </li>
        <li>Juice half of the lemon (about 1 1/2 tablespoon juice) and slice the remaining half in wedges.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice, whipping cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and Italian seasoning to the skillet</li>  
        <li>Simmer over medium-high, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits, 2 minutes.<br>
            Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and asparagus back into the skillet. Simmer until heated through and sauce reaches desired consistency, about 1 minute.<br>
            Serve with lemon wedges.</li>    
    </ol>
